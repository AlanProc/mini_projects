# Mini_projects
<strong>
I've learned a lot with educational websites like Digital Innovation One, W3 Schools, FreeCodeCamp, MDN Web Docs, JavaTPoint, StackOverFlow, and others I can't remember now. They have my grateful.
Here I'm uploading some of simple projects I learned using some of me of course.
Enjoy and let's share.
Be safe !
